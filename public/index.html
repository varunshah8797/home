      content="My name is Varun Shah. I'm a passionate software engineer with a Master of Science in Computer Science from California State University, Long Beach. My journey in the tech world began with an internship in January 2020, which quickly transitioned into a full-time Software Development Engineer role by May of the same year. My expertise spans across a variety of languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, to name a few. I'm adept with frameworks such as Node.js, React.js, and Spring Boot. On the technology front, I've hands-on experience with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and more. Database management? You bet! I've worked with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and even NoSQL databases. Whether it's developing a robust backend system or crafting a responsive frontend, I bring my A-game to the table. Let's code the future together!"

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
